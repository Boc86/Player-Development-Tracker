# Rugby Club Player Development Tracking App Design Document (Python Version)

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a comprehensive application tailored for rugby clubs, focusing on tracking player development during training and matches. The app will serve various stakeholders within the club, including coaches, head coaches, directors of rugby, administrators, and players themselves. Built with Python as the backend language using Django/Flask frameworks and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, this app aims to offer a robust solution for tracking player development.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Technology**: Web-based interface using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Bootstrap (for styling), D3.js or Plotly (for data visualization).

### Backend
- **Technology**: Python-based web framework (Flask).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for secure user authentication.
- **API**: RESTful API endpoints built using Django/Flask.

## Data Models

### Users
- Fields: Username, email, password (hashed), role (coach, admin, player).

### Players
- Fields: Name, position, team, date_of_birth, performance metrics.

### Teams
- Fields: Team name, coach, season details, match history.

### Coaches
- Fields: Coach profile, assigned teams, training schedules.

### Development Areas
- Fields: Skill type (tackling, passing), assessment criteria, progress tracking.

## Use Cases

### 1. Coach Dashboard
- **Features**: Add players, update profiles, assess skills, generate reports.
- **Process**: Coaches log in using JWT tokens to access player data and analytics.

### 2. Head Coach Dashboard
- **Features**: Oversee multiple teams, view league standings, manage staff.
- **Process**: Access aggregated data and performance metrics across teams.

### 3. Director of Rugby Dashboard
- **Features**: Strategic planning, budget management, policy review.
- **Process**: Review financial reports and organizational policies from the backend.

### 4. Administrator Dashboard
- **Features**: User management, database backup, system logs.
- **Process**: Manage user roles and permissions using Django admin panel.

### 5. Player Dashboard
- **Features**: View personal stats, set goals, track progress.
- **Process**: Players access their data through secure frontend interfaces.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for secure login sessions.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) using decorators in Django/Flask.
- **Data Protection**: HTTPS enforced for data transmission, encrypted storage of sensitive information.

## UI/UX Design Principles

- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Intuitive navigation with clear sections for each role.
- **Consistency**: Uniform design elements across all pages for a cohesive user experience.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring compatibility with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

## Conclusion
By transitioning to a Python-based backend with web frontend, the application offers enhanced scalability and maintainability. The robust integration of PostgreSQL, JWT authentication, and RESTful APIs ensures secure and efficient data handling. This solution is designed to meet the diverse needs of all stakeholders in a rugby club setting.
