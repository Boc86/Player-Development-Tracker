# Development Plan for Back End Integration and APIs

This comprehensive development plan outlines the steps required to implement the backend integration and APIs for the rugby club management application. The plan assumes no prior programming experience and provides clear, actionable instructions.

---

## 1. Prerequisites Setup
Before starting development, ensure the following tools are installed:
- **Python**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **VS Code**: Download from [vscode.dev](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **PostgreSQL**: Install locally or use Supabase.
- **Node.js** (optional for frontend): Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

---

## 2. Project Setup
### 2.1 Initialize the Project
Open VS Code and create a new folder for your project (e.g., `rugby_club_backend`). Inside this folder:
1. Open the terminal (`Ctrl+` or `Cmd+T`).
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`

### 2.2 Choose a Web Framework
- Use **Flask** for building RESTful APIs:
  ```bash
  pip install flask
  ```

## 3. Backend Development
### 3.1 Project Structure
Create the following directory structure in your project folder:
```
rugby_club_backend/
├── app/
│   ├── models/           # Database models
│   ├── routes/          # API endpoints
│   └── schemas/         # Data validation schemas
├── config.py            # Configuration settings
├── requirements.txt     # Dependency management
└── run.py               # Application entry point
```

### 3.2 Authentication Setup
- Use **JWT** for token-based authentication:
  ```bash
  pip install python-jose[cryptography]
  ```
- Create a `config.py` file to store API keys and database credentials.

### 3.3 Database Integration
1. Connect to PostgreSQL using Supabase:
   - Set up a Supabase account and create a database.
   - Add your database URL to the `.env` file:
     ```bash
     DB_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/database_name
     ```
2. Use **SQLAlchemy** for database interactions:
   ```bash
   pip install SQLAlchemy
   ```

---

## 4. Security and Best Practices
### 4.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Implement RBAC using decorators to enforce access control for different user roles (e.g., admin, coach, player).

### 4.2 Input Validation
- Use schemas to validate API requests:
  ```bash
  pip install pydantic
  ```

---

## 5. Core API Development
### 5.1 Define Models and Schemas
- Create models for database interactions (e.g., `User`, `Player`, `Team`).
- Define validation schemas using Pydantic.

### 5.2 Develop API Endpoints
Implement the following endpoints:
- **Users**: CRUD operations for user management.
- **Players**: CRUD operations for player stats and records.
- **Teams**: Manage team compositions and schedules.
- **Authentication**: Sign-up, login, and token refresh endpoints.

---

## 6. Testing
### 6.1 Write Unit Tests
- Use **pytest** to write unit tests:
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```
- Create a `tests/` directory for your test cases.

### 6.2 Test API Endpoints
- Use **Postman** or another tool to test API functionality.

---

## 7. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file to store environment variables:
```
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
SUPABASE_URL=https://<anon-key>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

---

## 8. Deployment
### 8.1 Containerization
- Use **Docker** to containerize the application:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.9-slim

  WORKDIR /app

  COPY requirements.txt .
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

  COPY . .

  EXPOSE 5000

  CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "--workers", "4", "app.run:app"]
  ```

### 8.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- Use **GitHub Actions** to automate testing and deployment.

---

## 9. Monitoring and Maintenance
### 9.1 Database Monitoring
- Use Supabase dashboard to monitor database performance.
- Set up regular backups.

### 9.2 Log Management
- Implement logging using the **logging module** in Python.

---

## 10. Review and Finalization
Before deployment, ensure:
- All functionality aligns with the design document.
- Security measures are implemented (e.g., RBAC, encryption).
- Testing covers all API endpoints.
- Environment variables are properly configured.
